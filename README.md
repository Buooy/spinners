# Spinners

Spinners: everyone needs them, no one wants to make them. Many of the ones you can scrape from the internet are kind of lame and only come in one size.

Here are some basic spinners with Apple-like proportions, available in 24px-192px sizes, so you can have spinners at 24px, 48px, and 96px at retina and normal resolutions.

Make those loading screens a bit more dapper, and always provide user feedback.

### Customize with Photoshop

Everything should be broken out into layers. If you need to modify the background colors, there should be a background layer in each file. Change the color, and add it to each pane of the animation.
